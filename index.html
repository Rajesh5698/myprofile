            <h1>Why Commutatus ?</h1>
        <span>
             <p>Eventhough I'm a Biomedical Engineering student, I always had a interest in learning how these games,software,
                websites works. I also want to build any one of it. So I learn basics of python, Java. while doing so I realised 
                that I had a interest in coding. 
            </p>

            <p>Then I found myself that I have a interest towards
                    building web application.So I decide to work towards it. when I came to know that you're expert in delivering wonderfull web application for
                    client, my heart said this is the right company for me.</p>
        </span>

        <span>
            <p>
                On shorlisted for the second round I'm very ecited. Within a day I learned basic of HTML and CSS to build a
                 my first website for Commutatus.
